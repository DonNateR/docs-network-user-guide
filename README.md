Rackspace Cloud Network Services User Guide 

Network services include:

* Cloud DNS
* Cloud Load Balancers
* Cloud Networks
* Rackspace RackConnect

This repo is a place to collect ideas for future document development. 
When the Network Services User Guide exists, it'll resemble the Core Infrastructure User Guide at https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/.
